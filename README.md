Data files:
.csv files contain the fold change in FOS expression data for each condition described in the manuscript (Fig. 2).

Code:
FOS_corr_network.R - used to generate FOS correlation networks and compute graph theory metrics (Fig. 3)
Gene_Coexpression.R - used to analyze normalized gene expression data from the Allen Institute (Fig. 4)
Emin_diff_node.m, min_eng_cont.m - used to compute change in minimum control energy (Fig. 5)
